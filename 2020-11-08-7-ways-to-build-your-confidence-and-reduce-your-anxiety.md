Many people struggle with their confidence throughout their life. It can be challenging to find the courage to be yourself in today’s society.

**As a result, here are 7 suggestions on how to increase your self-esteem and reduce your anxiety in your life.**

 

## **1\. Know your weaknesses and strengths:**

It is important to know what skills you have in your life. Taking a skills assessment test is a great way to determine your strengths and weaknesses. Once you realize your skill sets, the next step is to focus on your talents.

 

## **2\. Accept who you are:**

Do not get into the habit of comparing yourself to others. You are unique in this world and it is important that you realize that you can do anything you want if you put your mind to it.

 

## **3\. Remember your successes:**

Some people downplay their successes and focus on those things they struggle with. Always remind yourself of your past accomplishments no matter how small they may be.  Stop focusing on the negative parts of your life and remember your past achievements.

 

## **4\. Think about your future:**

Take time to think about what you really want out of life. Do not live your life for others. Once you determine what you want to accomplish, the next step is to develop a strategy that will help you to accomplish your goals.

 

## **5\. Create goals:**

Set achievable goals on a regular basis and then take small steps to accomplish them. Make sure your goals are measurable and monitor your progress. Don’t get upset if you don’t accomplish all of your goals. You can always change your goals so that you can be more successful.

 

## **6\. Talk to others:**

It is important that you talk to other successful people in order to get a better perspective of your life. Listening to other people’s challenges and accomplishments can go a long way in feeling better about yourself. You can also learn how to overcome the obstacles in your life.

 

## **7\. Be persistent:**

Do not give up in achieving your goals in your life. Learn from your mistakes and try to improve on your situation. Do not make excuses on why you should quit or give up. Sometimes it takes a lot of effort to be successful. The key is to keep at it until you get what you want.
