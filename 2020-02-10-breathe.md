My daughter recently took part in a poetry workshop at school.  Once it was over, her assignment for class was to write a poem and then deliver it in a spoken word poetry performance to her class.

She was extremely self-conscious about sharing with others in her school about her experience with anxiety, but I told her that she was likely helping others by sharing about what she has dealt with.

I asked her if I could share it here. 

This is my daughter's story.

 

**BREATHE**

_Breathe._

_Breathe._

_Breathe._

_You're ok._

_You're ok._ 

_No one noticed your scream inside._

_No one noticed your heart pounding,_

_Head racing_

_Hands shaking_

_Breath barely escaping!_

_You're ok._

_You're ok._

_Even though you have a test tomorrow,_

_And your mom is sick,_

_And you can’t help but let the thoughts flick-er through your mind!_

_It’s unfair! It’s disastrous its just- its just-_

_Just_

_Just_ 

_Breathe_

_Just breathe_

_Just._

_Breathe…_

_Feel your forehead, sweat perspiring._

_I wish I could be like those who are inspiring_

_But,_

_But no._

_I am me, with my shaky hands!_

_My too fast heart!_

_And my head like sand running through a timer,_

_Constantly burning like a fire._ 

_Breathe!_

_Just Breathe._

_You got this,_

_Just keep it together until you get home!_

_Where your dad can hug you and tell you, you're not alone._

_Walk down the hallway binders in hand._

_You move your hands to adjust your headband-_

_OH NO!_

_It’s him!_

_The one that you like,_

_Coming up to you with that sweetest smile_

_Here comes that feeling of denial_

_He’s to cool for you_ 

_You can’t talk to- Hey!_

_He says right to your face_

_Your cheeks go red_ 

_And you hesitate_ 

_As you walk away, messing things up_ 

_OH! Why am I such a nut!_

_There it is again that feeling of disgust-ed with yourself_ 

_Why are you here when you should be studying!_

_But you can’t with thoughts of him, and your mom_

_Your mom!_

_OH_ 

_There it is again!_

_Heart pounding_

_Head racing_ 

_Hands shaking_

_Breath barely escaping_

_My chest is collapsing_

_My balance is breaking_

_My anxiety is over taking!_

_Just breathe!_

_I CAN’T!_

_Just breathe._

_I ‘ll try._

_Just breathe._ 

_I can._

_Just-_

_Breathe._

_I’m Breathing,_

_I’m Breathing._
